# Shopping cart mini practice project
The main goal of this project is just to practice a little bit more before moving to next level.
this is not the first react project , and it will not be the last (ان شاء لله). I just wanted to put some projects I've done as checkpoint so that will help me to track my level.
## How to run it
```bash 
git clone [URL]
cd [path of the project]
npm i #To install the necessary modules
npm run dev
```
## Technologies I used
- HTML
- SASS
- React.js
- Vite
  
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
